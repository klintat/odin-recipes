        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of gluten-free pizza crust mix or 1 pre-made gluten-free pizza crust</li>
            <li>1 cup of gluten-free tomato sauce or pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese or your preferred gluten-free cheese blend</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of thinly sliced gluten-free salami or pepperoni (ensure it's gluten-free certified)</li>
            <li><strong>Optional toppings :</strong>bell peppers, onions, black olives, fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes for added spice, grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the gluten-free pizza crust package or recipe (usually around 450°F/230°C).</li>
            <li>Prepare the Crust: If you're using a pre-made gluten-free pizza crust, follow the package instructions for preparation. If you're using a pizza crust mix, prepare the dough according to the instructions. Usually, you'll need to combine the mix with water, oil, and let it rise if required.</li>
            <li>Roll Out the Dough: Place the dough on a clean, gluten-free floured surface or parchment paper. Roll it out into your desired pizza crust shape, ensuring it's evenly thick.</li>
            <li>Spread Tomato Sauce: Spread the gluten-free tomato sauce evenly over the pizza crust, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
            <li>Add Cheese: Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese or your chosen cheese blend over the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Layer Salami: Add the thinly sliced gluten-free salami on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Customize with Toppings: If you want additional toppings like sliced bell peppers, onions, olives, or other ingredients, add them at this stage.</li>
            <li>Bake: Carefully transfer the pizza (on parchment paper, if used) onto a pizza stone, pizza pan, or directly onto the oven rack. Bake in the preheated oven for the time specified on your crust package or recipe (usually 10-15 minutes, but it can vary).</li>
            <li>Check for Doneness: The pizza is done when the crust is golden brown, the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, and any meat toppings (like salami) are cooked.</li>
            <li>Slice and Serve: Remove the pizza from the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Slice it into desired portions and serve hot.</li> 
        </ol>
