            <li>Pour the yeast mixture into the sour cream mixture and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a clean cloth and let it rise for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Prepare the Filling:</h4>

            <li>Place a small spoonful of the bacon and onion filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, then pinch the edges to seal the bun.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Bake the Bacon Buns:</h4>

            <li>Place the assembled bacon buns on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
